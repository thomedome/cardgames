# Blackjack (Archived)

A simple Blackjack using OOP in Python.
This was one of my early attempts at designing game logic using classes and objects.
Partially functional, but does contain a few bugs.

## Concepts
- Practice with OOP, using the __init__ and __str__ functions to define cards.
- Cross-communication with different classes and objects.
- Structuring small CLI games.
